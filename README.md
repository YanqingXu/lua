## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run the project, you will need:

- A C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+).
- A build system (e.g., Make, Ninja, or Visual Studio).

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YanqingXu/lua
   cd lua
   ```

2. Create a build directory and navigate to it:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Build the project using your preferred build system or IDE.

### Running the Interpreter

After building, you can run the Lua interpreter in several ways:

#### Interactive Mode
```bash
./lua
```

This starts the interactive REPL where you can execute Lua commands:
```lua
Lua 5.1.1  Copyright (C) 1994-2024 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
> x = 42
> print(x * 2)
84
> function factorial(n)
>>   return n <= 1 and 1 or n * factorial(n-1)
>> end
> print(factorial(5))
120
```

#### Script Execution
```bash
./lua script.lua
```

#### Code Execution
```bash
./lua -e "print('Hello from command line!')"
```

### Running Tests

We provide comprehensive testing with multiple test suites:

#### Unit Tests
```bash
ctest                    # Run all tests
ctest -V                 # Verbose output
ctest -R "lexer"         # Run specific test category
```

#### Performance Benchmarks
```bash
./tests/benchmark_tests  # Run performance benchmarks
```

#### Compatibility Tests
```bash
./tests/compatibility_tests  # Test Lua compatibility
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Lua Features
```lua
-- Variables and basic types
local name = "Lua"
local version = 5.1
local is_awesome = true

-- Tables (associative arrays)
local person = {
    name = "Alice",
    age = 30,
    hobbies = {"reading", "coding", "gaming"}
}

-- Functions
function greet(name)
    return "Hello, " .. name .. "!"
end

-- Control structures
for i = 1, 10 do
    if i % 2 == 0 then
        print(i .. " is even")
    end
end

-- Iterators
for key, value in pairs(person) do
    print(key .. ": " .. tostring(value))
end
```

### Advanced Features
```lua
-- Closures and upvalues
function createCounter()
    local count = 0
    return function()
        count = count + 1
        return count
    end
end

local counter = createCounter()
print(counter())  -- 1
print(counter())  -- 2

-- Metatables
local mt = {
    __add = function(a, b)
        return {x = a.x + b.x, y = a.y + b.y}
    end
}

local v1 = setmetatable({x = 1, y = 2}, mt)
local v2 = setmetatable({x = 3, y = 4}, mt)
local v3 = v1 + v2  -- {x = 4, y = 6}
```
